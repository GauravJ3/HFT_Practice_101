A high frequency trading firm(Simulation) made in Rust


## Creating a low-latency trading system in Rust involves several steps. A high-level approach and suggestion for resources to help you get started. Here's how you can approach each step:

### Create a WebSocket server in Rust:

* Rust provides libraries like tokio and actix-web that can help you build WebSocket servers. You can start by exploring these libraries and their documentation.
* The Rust Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great resource for learning Rust and understanding the fundamentals of networking.

### Send data similar to trading applications:

* You'll need to define the structure of the data you want to send and receive. This might include creating order and cancel order messages.
* Rust's strong type system can be helpful in defining the data structures. Consider using Rust's serde library (https://serde.rs/) for serialization and deserialization of the data.

### Compress data as much as possible using Protocol Buffers (protobuf):

* Protocol Buffers is a language-agnostic binary serialization format that can help reduce the size of the data being transmitted.
* The protobuf crate in Rust (https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf) provides support for working with Protocol Buffers in Rust.
* You can read the Protocol Buffers documentation (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to understand how to define your message structures and generate Rust code from them.

### Regionally distribute the trading application and send trades closer to the main server:

* To achieve regional distribution, you can deploy instances of your WebSocket server in different regions.
* You'll need to set up a communication mechanism between these instances and the main server to exchange trading data.
* Consider using a message queue or a publish-subscribe system, like Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/), to distribute the trades closer to the main server.
* The Rust ecosystem provides libraries for working with Kafka, such as rdkafka (https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka).
In addition to the resources mentioned above, you can find more tutorials, examples, and community support by exploring the Rust ecosystem. The official Rust website (https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a good starting point.

Remember that building a low-latency trading system requires careful consideration of performance, networking, and security. It's important to benchmark and optimize your code and follow best practices specific to the trading industry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Benchmarking and optimizing your code for a low-latency trading system involves several considerations. Here are some steps you can take, along with further reading resources to explore:

### Profiling and Performance Optimization:

* Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code. Rust provides the cargo flamegraph (https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) and cargo-profiler (https://github.com/ferrous-systems/cargo-profiler) crates to help with profiling.
* Read about Rust's performance optimization techniques, such as avoiding unnecessary allocations, minimizing function calls, and utilizing low-level abstractions. The "Optimization" chapter in the Rust Performance Book (https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/) can be a valuable resource.
### Network Optimization:

* Ensure your WebSocket server is configured for optimal network performance. Consider factors like TCP/IP tuning, buffer sizes, and congestion control algorithms.
* The "Networking" section of the Rust Performance Book (https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/) provides guidance on optimizing network-related code.
### Memory Optimization:

* Minimize memory allocations and deallocations, as they can introduce latency. Utilize Rust's ownership and borrowing system to manage memory efficiently.
* The Rustnomicon's "Efficiency" chapter (https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/efficiency.html) covers advanced memory management techniques in Rust.
### Best Practices in the Trading Industry:

* Research and adhere to best practices specific to the trading industry. This may include topics like order book management, market data processing, and risk management.
* Familiarize yourself with industry standards like the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol (https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/) for electronic trading communication.
* Consider reading books and articles on algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading to gain insights into the domain-specific considerations.
### Further Reading Resources:

- "Rust Performance Book" by The Rust Performance Group: https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/
- "The Rustnomicon" for advanced Rust topics: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/
- "High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik (Although focused on web applications, it covers network performance concepts that can be applied to any networking system): https://hpbn.co/

Remember that each trading system has unique requirements, and it's important to continually measure and optimize based on your specific use case.
